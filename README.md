# Ansible Role: bigiq_apps_rbac

Performs a series of steps needed to assign Application Services Viewer or Manager roles to users having access to existing top Application object in BIG-IQ.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below. For their default values, see `defaults/main.yml`.

Establishes initial connection to your BIG-IQ. These values are substituted into
your ``provider`` module parameter. These values should be the connection parameters
for the **CM BIG-IQ** device.

        provider:
          user: admin
          server: 10.1.1.4
          server_port: 443
          password: secret
          auth_provider: tmos
          validate_certs: false

Define the application role name and application service role name.
Look under BIG-IQ **System > Role Management > Roles > Custom Roles > Application Roles** to see the application roles.
The role name is based on the app name + Viewer or Manager. Example below with an Application called `BusinessUnit1` and
an Application Service called `App1_MyHttpService`.

    application_role_name: "BusinessUnit1 Viewer"
    application_service_role_name: "App1_MyHttpService Viewer"
